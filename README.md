# ecom_hub

This website is an ecommerce website. It's not meant to be used for production. It simply meant to showcase my prowess as a programmer. For a functional ecommerce 
website the following would be needed:

1.Shipping calculators
2.Production Paypal API
3.Each product item must have its own link.
4.UPS tracking API
5.Secure checkout for credit/debit cards. And hash storage for them.

To get this website working all you need to do is import the ecom_hub.sql file into your mysql/mariadb table.
This website also experimented with pdo so certain php links must be changed accordingly:
1.Time handler.php
2.validate_input.php
3.sign_up_process.php
4.orderplacement.php
